A Few Tutorials and Tricks for Python, Jupyter and Rise

This repository gathers a few tutorials I made for the Lincs and for my teachings. It contains the following files:
- *Python-Guide.ipynb*: learn to install and use Python in five minutes (initially designed for the Master ACN Inf674 module)
- *NoteBookGuide.ipynb*: A NoteBook more specifically dedicated to what you can do with... NoteBooks
- *NotebookPresentation.ipynb*: A Rise presentation inspired from the NoteBook Guide. To enjoy it, you have to launch the NoteBook locally (not view from GitHub) with Rise enabled. Alternatively, you can view the HTML version, *NoteBookPresentation.standalone.html*.
- *Rise2HTML.ipynb*: A NoteBook that explains the art of exporting a working, standalone version of a Rise presentation.
